        REST
        Architectual style
        Representational state transfer
        networked applications

        CONSTRAINTS OF REST
        Client-Server: 
            -> Client requests data from server and the server responds with data
        Requests and responses
            -> Often called messages
            -> HTTP requests are made up
                -> request line
                    -> This will have the method (The operatiion you want to perform) and a path (Where we perform this operation)
                -> headers
                    -> Contain info about the message, inc metadata (Who sent it, when it was sent, data types being sent, etc)
                -> message body
                    -> The actual content of the message, data being sent.

        Responses are the same BUT have a status line instead of a request line.
        status line contains a status code and a status text (404 not found)

        UNIFORM INTERFACE
        -> the interferface or connection between the server and any client should be immutable.
        -> The client and server can evolve seperately

        STATELESS
        -> each request should contain ALL information needed to handle a transaction
        -> It makes the server much more efficient

        CACHEABLE
        -> On the client-side when data is receieved it should contain info on if it can be cacheable
        -> This optimizes performance and save on data transfer costs.

        LAYERED SYSTEM  
        -> As we scale infrastructure on the server it should have NO effect on any of the clients. 
        -> It allows us to add middleware.

        REST IN ACTION
        CRUD 
        Create
        Read
        Update
        Delete
    
    HTTP REQUEST METHODS
    ->GET - READ
    ->HEAD
    ->POST - CREATE
    ->PUT - UPDATE
    ->DELETE - DELETE
    ->TRACE
    ->CONNECT
    ->OPTIONS
    ->PATCH - UPDATE

    POST METHODS
    -> used for creating resources
    -> data sent in message body
    -> response -> code: 201
                -> text : created
    POST /houses/create/
    'content-type : application/JSON'
    {
        address: "1, road",
        postcode: "ab1 2cd",
        value: 0.99
    }
    GET
    -> used to retrieve resources
    -> response -> code: 200
                -> text: ok
    GET /houses/read
    OR
    GET /houses/read/id

    PUT // OR PATCH - PATCH IS BETTER
    -> used to replace a resources
    -> response -> code : 200
                -> text : ok
    -> some devs change this to -> code : 202
                                -> text : accepted
    PUT /houses/update/2
    'content-type : application/JSON'
    {
        address : "1, road",
        postcode: "ab1 2cd",
        value : 250,000
    }

    DELETE
    -> used to remove a resources
    -> response -> code : 200
                -> text : ok
    -> sometimes changed to -> code : 204
                            -> text : No content
    DELETE /houses/delete/2(id)
